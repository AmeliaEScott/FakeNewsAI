# FakeNewsAI
Project for CS472: An artificial intelligence that can detect fake news

### Goal
The goal of this project is to create an AI that accepts a URL for a news article, and outputs
a probability from 0 to 1 that the article is "fake news".

### Project Structure

The directory `WebScraper/` contains the code we used to gather our dataset of 95 thousand news articles.

The directory `AITests/` contains the code we used to learn Tensorflow, and to train the neural network.

The directory `FakeNewsWebsite/` is a Django project, which is the final product of this project.
