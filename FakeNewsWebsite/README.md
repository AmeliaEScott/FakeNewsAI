This directory is a Django project, which contains all of our website code. The folder `FakeNewsWebsite/`
contains code generated by Django. Our actual code is all in `FakeNewsApp/`.

The most important files are `FakeNewsApp/urls.py`, `FakeNewsApp/views.py`, and anything in the
directories `FakeNewsApp/static` and `FakeNewsApp/templates`.

#### Setup

The following libraries need to be installed using pip:

 - `gensim`
 - `tensorflow`
 - `newspaper3k`
 - `django`
 
Next, the language model needs to be downloaded 
from [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYaDBDQm1tZGNDRHc/edit).

Put this file at `FakeNewsWebsite/FakeNewsApp/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin`.
(This is important because these scripts will have to reference this file by name)

Finally, the variables must be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzbcavI-ypX2enlrc2pKVHg4eXM), and
unzipped into `FakeNewsWebsite/FakeNewsApp/VariableCheckpoints/`
 
#### Running

To run a local test server, simply do `python manage.py runserver`, and visit `http://localhost:8000/`
in your web browser. Do **not** use this command to run the website exposed to the internet. It is
intended for development only, and exposing it to the internet can be a security risk.
