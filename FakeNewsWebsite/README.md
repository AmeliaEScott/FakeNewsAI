This directory is a Django project, which contains all of our website code. The folder `FakeNewsWebsite/`
contains code generated by Django. Our actual code is all in `FakeNewsApp/`.

The most important files are `FakeNewsApp/urls.py` and `FakeNewsApp/views.py`.

#### Setup

The following libraries need to be installed using pip:

 - `gensim`
 - `tensorflow`
 - `newspaper3k`
 - `psycopg2`
 - `django`
 
#### Running

To run a local test server, simply do `python manage.py runserver`, and visit `http://localhost:8000/`
in your web browser. Do **not** use this command to run the website exposed to the internet. It is
intended for development only, and exposing it to the internet can be a security risk.
